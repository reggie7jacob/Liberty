This is an attempt to find solutions to some of the problems 
Mockito is not yet implemented, although it took some time to get it working.
As of now Mockito framework itself has not been yet used, I will definitely work 
on this later as it is a very usefull tool to test ahead of the implementation 
and integration betwween APIs and backent as well.
